// For a given string s find the character c (or C) with longest consecutive repetition and return:

// [c, l]
// where l (or L) is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same l return the first in order of appearance.

// For empty string return:

// ["", 0]
// In JavaScript: If you use Array.sort in your solution, you might experience issues with the random tests as Array.sort is not stable in the Node.js version used by CodeWars. This is not a kata issue.

// Happy coding! :)
